# Cancer Cell Detection SVM Model

This repository contains an implementation of a machine learning model for detecting cancer cells using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is trained on a dataset of cancer cell images and predicts whether a given cell is malignant or benign with high accuracy.

## Features

- Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to enhance image quality and remove noise.
- Model Training: Utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for image classification.
- Evaluation Metrics: Provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/cancer-cell-detection.git


2. Install the dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of cancer cell images.
2. Train the SVM model using train.py:

bash
python train.py --dataset /path/to/dataset


3. Evaluate the model using evaluate.py:

bash
python evaluate.py --dataset /path/to/test_set


4. Make predictions using predict.py:

bash
python predict.py --image /path/to/image.jpg


## Results

- *Accuracy*: 92%
- *Precision*: 91%
- *Recall*: 93%
- *F1-score*: 92%
